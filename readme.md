# Python Curses OBD Dashboard

This is currently a work-in-progress project to build a visual dashboard entirely in the terminal using curses. In the project's current state, I have not yet reached the point of collecting the data from the OBD adapter.

This will be the next step in the process and I hope to have a fully functional dashboard by the end of March.
